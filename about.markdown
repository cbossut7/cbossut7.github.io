Hello! I'm Camille (Camie) Bossut, a new PhD student at Georgia Tech. I work with Dr.Qirun Zhang in the field of programming languages. I'm interested in static analysis and code optimization; I like using static information to prove useful properties and give guarantees for the programmer, or use for optimizations for perfomance improvements.
