Hello! I'm Camille (Camie) Bossut, a third-year PhD student at Georgia Tech. I work under Dr. Qirun Zhang on static program analysis and optimization. I really love math, particularly the discrete kind, so naturally I've got a side interest in cryptography. In my free time I do art (traditional and digital) and I like fantasy and sci-fi type shows/books.
